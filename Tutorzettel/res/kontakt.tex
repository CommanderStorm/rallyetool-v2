For the communication we use Slack (\url{https://campusrallye2019.slack.com}).

\subsection*{Communication}
To join the workspace, visit the following page: \url{https://bit.ly/2p417os}.  
Enter your (real) name (Important, because we want to know who is in the channel ;)). Then follow the Slack-Guide to finish the registration. \\ 

It is highly recommended that you install a slack client on your phone to be notified of important announcements. \\

If you have questions about your station or if you have problems, you can reach us there via the channel \textbf{rallye}. Please \textbf{always} mention the number of the station! \\
