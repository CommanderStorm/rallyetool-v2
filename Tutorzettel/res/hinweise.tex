The Rallye will take place from 11:00 to 14:00. During this time you have to be at the station assigned to you. \\

When a group arrives at your stop, briefly explain what they have to do. After the group has completed the station, enter the achieved score next to the group number in the attached list.\\

When the Rallye is over, enter the points of the groups in the Rallye tool (make sure to also enter the points in the list!). \\
The link to the tool as well as additional information about the process can be found on slack.

This note (all pages), as well as all the material we provided you with, has to be handed in at the information desk after the Rallye. Please make sure to leave your spot clean!
